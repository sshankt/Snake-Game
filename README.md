# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake Game developed using Python and the pygame library. Control the snake, eat apples, grow longer, and avoid colliding with yourself or the boundaries!

## 📝 Description
In this Snake Game, you play as a growing snake that moves across the screen eating apples. Each apple you eat increases your score and lengthens your snake. But beware—hitting the screen boundaries or your own body will end the game!

## 🚀 Features
Classic gameplay: Control the snake to eat apples and grow longer.
Real-time score and timer: Track your score and the time you’ve survived.
Game over detection: Collision with walls or the snake's own body ends the game.
